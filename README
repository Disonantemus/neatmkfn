MKTRFN
======

The mktrfn program creates troff font description files for neatroff
from AFM (Adobe Font Metrics), TrueType, and OpenType fonts.  For
TrueType and OpenType fonts, mktrfn depends on the otfdump program
that comes with heirloom-docutils.  See the output of "mktrfn -h" for
the available options.

The included ./gen.sh script invokes mktrfn to create a complete
output device for neatroff.  Change the variables in that file before
running it.
