MKTRFN
======

The mktrfn program creates troff font description files for neatroff
from AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) and TTF (TrueType Font) files.  OpenType
fonts can be first converted to TTF (see ./gen.sh, for instance).  See
the output of "mktrfn -h" for the available options.

The included ./gen.sh script invokes mktrfn to create a complete
output device for neatroff.  Change the variables in that file before
running it.
