MKTRFN
======

The mktrfn program creates troff font description files for neatroff
from AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) and TTF (TrueType Font) files.  OpenType
fonts can be first converted to TTF (see ./gen.sh, for instance).  See
the output of "mktrfn -h" for the available options.

The included ./gen.sh script invokes mktrfn to create a complete
output device for neatroff.  Change the variables in that file before
running it.

By default, font features are ordered as specified in the font.
However, in some languages like Arabic, some features should be
applied first.  The -O argument of mkfn allows specifying the features
to output before any other feature.  For instance for Arabic, one
should pass "-O ccmp,rlig,calt,liga,dlig,cswh,mset" to mkfn.
